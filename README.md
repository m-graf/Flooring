## Flooring Question
Imagine for a moment that you work for a flooring company. You’ve been laying hardwood floors for a while and you find yourself in a rather peculiar situation. To your surprise, Eric, your coworker with the only saw has left and has taken the saw with him. You look at the scrap pile of hardwood that remains and you find the following pieces.


|Quantity|Length (cm)|Height (cm)|
| :- | :- | :- |
|10|90|10|
|10|45|10|
|20|22.5|10|
|20|8|10|

You’re determined to lay the hardwood flooring in the last room of the customers home, and agree to finish the job. The room that you’re going to be flooring has the dimensions of 196cm x 100cm.

The customer heard that you were a great programmer, and requested a script that would do the following:

- Use no more materials than you found in the scrap pile (the customer is environmentally conscious)
- Output a visual of the completed room, which will include a grid of what size pieces are used in a particular row.
- Bonus points if each execution of the script produces different results (within possibility).


Example result:


Notes:

- Let’s assume greater-than-human precision is at play, and there are no imperfections in the room, wood, etc.
